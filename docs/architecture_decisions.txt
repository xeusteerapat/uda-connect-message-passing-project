Architecture Design Decisions

1. Persons API and Connections API
Both services are based on RESTful web services architecture, that allows Frontend app get the data
via HTTP methods

2. Locations service
Assume that clients allow to use their geolocation. The Locations service is separate into 2 parts
- Locations producer: This service use location data along with the person_id produces the message
  using Kafka messaging service.
- Location consumer: Consumes the data that produces by the producer then save the data to the database.
